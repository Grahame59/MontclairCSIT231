I don't know how much coding will be put into this probably just my projects... 
- MultiThread Project I want to refactor to have the logic be drawn and rendered into a WinForms App...
      - Its a project for Sphere Estimation using the MonteCarlo method with v1 having Linux and Win32 compatibility.
